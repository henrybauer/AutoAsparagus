AutoAsparagus
=============

AutoAsparagus mod for Kerbal Space Program

* What does this mod do?
It moves parts (decouplers and sepratrons) into proper stages for asparagus staging, based on your fuel lines. It does not run the fuel lines for you.

* What is Asparagus Staging?
See http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Asparagus_Staging

* How do I install this mod?
Same as any other mod, put it in GameData.  See also http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Addon#How_to_install_addons

* How do I use this mod?
In the editor, build a ship.
The ship should have fuel tanks in symmetry, attached by decouplers to something.
Run your own fuel lines to define the fuel flow.
Find the stage where your decouplers are.  Add some empty stages below it.  This isn't required, but it will make a mess otherwise.  If you have 4-way symmetry, you'll need 2 stages total, so add one empty stage.  If you have 6-way, 3 stages total, so add two empty stages. 8-way, 4 stages total, add 3 empty stages.
Push the button.
After pushing the button, you must either add an empty stage and then delete it, or save the ship and reload it.  No, I don't know why.  If you don't do this, and then add something that adds a stage, the staging will revert!

=== FAQ ===

* Does the mod support multiple aparagus rings?
  Yes!  You can have one ring that feeds into another, and you can have completely different rings.
