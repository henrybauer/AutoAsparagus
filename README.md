AutoAsparagus
=============

* AutoAsparagus mod for Kerbal Space Program

Asparagus staging is awesome, but tedious. So, I built a plugin to do it for me! 

The plugin can create fuel lines if you have none, or it can use your existing fuel lines. Based on the fuel lines, it will put decouplers and sepratrons into proper stages.
